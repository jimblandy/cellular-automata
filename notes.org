* Outline

- pre-talk: show code
- title page
- screen: glider, moving slowly across page
  - glider: the photon of a simulated universe
  - the rules real-world particles follow are difficult to solve, and random
  - frustrating
  - what's wonderful about the glider's universe:
    - rules are *easy* but still *interesting*
- screen: neighborhood; counts
- rule:

** Hashlife
  - Good demo [[file:///usr/share/golly/Patterns/HashLife/hashlife-oddity2.mc][HashLife Oddity 2]]
    - modest beginning
    - fast: let generation get up into 10**9 (step = 8^7 or so?)
    - at 1.7e10:
      - zoom in on NE-bound spike approaching center spine: it's incredibly sparse gliders
      - zoom in on center spine: very regular, hence hashlife-friendly
** von Neumann and his successors
  - 
  - note that Langston is sort of cheating, by dropping universality
  - close with [[http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Replicator_%28CA%29][Fredkin's replicator]], using [[file:///usr/share/golly/Patterns/Life-Like/replicator.rle][OK!]]: all patterns in this rule replicate.

** Wireworld
  This would be a good one to actually explain and work through in detail
  eventually show [[file:///usr/share/golly/Patterns/WireWorld/primes.mc][primes]]

** Misc patterns to show:
- [[file:///usr/share/golly/Patterns/Life/Miscellaneous/Cambrian-Explosion.rle][Cambrian-Explosion.rle]]
- Zig-zag Wick Stretcher - have this zoom in from below
  file:///usr/share/golly/Patterns/Life/Puffers/zigzag-wickstretcher.rle
- All two-glider collisions:
  file:///usr/share/golly/Patterns/Life/Syntheses/two-glider-collisions.rle
